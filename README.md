## Overview

This repository contains three JavaScript programs: the Speed Calculator, the Grade Calculator and the Net Salary Calculator. These programs perform the following tasks:

### Speed Calculator

The Speed Calculator is designed to calculate demerit points for a car's speed based on user input. It also determines if the driver's license should be suspended if they accumulate more than 12 points.

### Grade Calculator

The Grade Calculator calculates student grades based on input marks. It assigns grades A, B, C, D, or E according to predefined criteria. We import the 'readline' module to read input from the terminal. We then define a function to calculate the grades.
The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below:

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

### Net Salary Calculator

The program's major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
